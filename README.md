# Task: Develop a Simulation System for a zoo
"""
Background:
Developing an object-oriented system to a simulate a zoo. The system should manage different types of animals and their interactions within the park. The goal is to create a dynamic environment where animals can eat, sleep and interact with each other and park’s visitors.
Specifications:
1.	Basics Objects
  •	Animal: The base class for all types of animals. Common attributes may include name, age and energy level. Basic method might be to eat, sleep and make sounds.
  •	Herbivores and Carnivores: Subclasses that inherit from Animal, with specific characteristic and behaviours.
  •	Visitors: A class to represent the visitors in the park, with attribute like name and age.
2.	Features
  •	Create specific animal species such as lions, elephants and giraffes with unique characteristic and behaviours.
  •	Implement interactions between animals, like hunting or playing.
  •	Allow visitors to “feed” certain animals species, affecting their energy levels
  •	Simulate a day in the zoo, where animals follow their natural routines and interact with visitors
3.	Challenges:
  •	Managing the energy levels of animals and ensuring they eat and rest regularly.
  •	Modelling predator-prey relationship in a way that is balances and doesn’t lead to any species quickly being “eradicated” from the simulation.
  •	Creating an engaging and interactive experience for the visitor through the interface.
